\section*{Course Description}

This course is an introduction to the Rust programming language, a memory-safe
systems programming language. We will cover a range of topics, from the Rust borrow checker
to parallelism and the \code{unsafe} keyword.
Outside of lecture, there will be basic programming exercises, and during the second half of
the semester there will be a small student-defined project.

This course is taught in Rust, and you are not expected to have any prior exposure to Rust.
However, this course assumes knowledge of topics covered by \textbf{15--122},
or equivalent experience with the C programming language.
Knowledge of functional programming idioms taught in \textbf{15--150},
as well as knowledge of systems programming taught in \textbf{15--213} is a bonus,
but not strictly required.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Learning Objectives}

Students in this course will be able to read, write,
and reason about Rust code which includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Core Rust syntax such as \code{struct}, \code{enum}, \code{impl}
        blocks, pattern matching, polymorphism, and traits
    \item Common Rust types such as \code{Vec<T>}, \code{String}, \code{\&str},
        \code{Option<T>}, and \code{Result<T, E>}
    \item Use of the borrow checker through ownership and \code{move} semantics
    \item Advanced Rust features such as iterators, lifetimes, closures, and smart pointers
    \item Advanced Rust patterns such as parallelism, concurrency, macros, and \code{unsafe}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Additional Materials}

Access to a computer able to run \texttt{rustc} (the Rust compiler) and \texttt{cargo}
(the Rust package manager) is required for this course.
If you are on stable versions of Mac, Windows, or Linux, you should be fine.
We'll go over how to set these up in class with \texttt{rustup},
Rust's official tool chain manager, or you can follow the steps from
the official Rust \href{https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install}{\color{blue}{website}}.

\section*{Attendance Policy}

Attendance is mandatory, as well as 50\% of your grade.
\textbf{As per StuCo guidelines, if you have three
unexcused absences, you will automatically fail this course}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Grading}

The final course grade will be calculated using the following categories.
% The course is out of 1000 points.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}}
        Assessment Type                 & Total Points \\ \toprule
        Participation and Attendance    &          500 \\
        Programming Assignments         &          500 \\ \midrule
        Total                           &         1000 \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Grades will be assigned as follows, based on the number of points earned.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}

\subsection*{Participation}

We will take attendance with a sign-in sheet or an interactive activity.

If you need to miss a session for a reason we can reasonably excuse, contact us
and we will determine an appropriate alternative so you don't miss out on that
week's content.

\subsection*{Homework}

There will be weekly homeworks where you will write Rust code applying topics we've
discussed in lecture.
Homeworks are designed to take around an hour per week.
If they take longer than this, please tell us!
\textbf{All homeworks are due the week after they are released}.

We expect you to turn in a submission for every homework, but they are mainly graded
for effort, not correctness. If you put in a good faith effort to complete the homework
and do not manage fully complete it, you will still receive credit.

\subsection*{Late work}

Students have 7 late days to be used for any assignment.
Under special circumstances, if you let us know in advance, you can get more late days.

\section*{Course Note}

\subsection*{Academic Integrity}

Discussion of homework problems, written or verbal, is not only permitted, but encouraged.
That being said, verbatim or like-verbatim copying of
answers over any medium is expressly forbidden.
If you find yourself needing to do this, talk to us!
It might be the case that a change needs to happen on our end, not yours.

\subsection*{Accommodations for students with disabilities}

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability
Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with
us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure that
accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a
disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with
the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them at
\href{mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu}{\texttt{access@andrew.cmu.edu}}.

\subsection*{Statement on student wellness}

Take care of yourself.  Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this
semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough
sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is
learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is
almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to
seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call
412-268-2922 and visit their website at \url{http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/}.
Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help
getting connected to the support that can help.

\subsection*{Statement on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion}

We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and
this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and
inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we
identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin,
language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion,
creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these
diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the
perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU,
will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity
fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We
acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and
outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that
increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional
or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for
individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages
anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of
identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident
or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the
following resources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion:
        \href{mailto:csdi@andrew.cmu.edu}{csdi@andrew.cmu.edu},
        (412) 268-2150
    \item Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: \url{reportit.net}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item username: tartans
        \item password: plaid
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be
any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all
shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and
just.
